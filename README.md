Key Findings
1. Descriptive Statistics
* Mean Sales: 73.25
* Standard Deviation of Sales: 66.74
* Median Sales: 50.00

2. Correlation Analysis
* Sales and Profit: Positive correlation (0.5016) indicating that higher sales generally lead to higher profit.
* Discount and Profit: Negative correlation (-0.4832) showing that increasing discounts significantly reduce profits.
* Shipping Cost and Profit: Moderate positive correlation (0.3871) indicating that higher shipping costs may align with higher profits.

* Outliers in Sales and Profit: Detected through Boxplot Analysis, suggesting extreme values that could be further investigated.
Discounts beyond a certain level lead to diminishing returns, as highlighted in the negative correlation with Profit.

5. Visualizations:
* Histograms were created for numerical columns to visualize their distributions.
* Boxplots highlighted outliers in continuous variables such as Sales and Profit.
* Heatmap visualized the correlation matrix, revealing relationships between key variables.
